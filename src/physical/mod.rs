//! Physical execution plan operators for ADR-0002 contract-native enforcement.
//!
//! Wave 9 — physical operator layer.  These are DataFusion `ExecutionPlan`
//! implementations that correspond 1-to-1 with the four wave-8 logical-plan
//! optimizer rules.  Wave 9 also introduces `AttestationExec`, the top-level
//! wrapper that produces a cryptographic `AttestationEnvelope` for each query.
//!
//! # Operator pipeline (physical)
//!
//! ```text
//! AttestationExec (wraps entire pipeline)
//!   └─ LaplaceNoiseExec
//!       └─ MaskingExec
//!           └─ RowFilterExec
//!               └─ ContractApprovedExec
//!                   └─ ScanMetricsExec (records raw scan rows/bytes; ADR-0052 follow-up #42)
//!                       └─ <any DataFusion physical plan>
//! ```
//!
//! # ADR-0002 verified-binary surface
//!
//! All operators in this module MUST:
//! (a) Contain no `unsafe` code.
//! (b) Be sealed: no public constructors that bypass the contract bundle.
//! (c) Emit a structured event for every enforcement decision so
//!     `AttestationExec` can include it in the attestation envelope.
//!
//! # Semantic Law coverage
//!
//! * INV-1 (no data in without contract): `ContractApprovedExec` enforces.
//! * INV-2 (no read without satisfaction): `RowFilterExec` + `MaskingExec` enforce.
//! * INV-4 (no AI without provenance): `AttestationExec` provides the provenance
//!   envelope for every result stream (placeholder signature until wave 10 Sigstore).
//! * INV-5 (no bypass from above trust line): no import from zone-t.
